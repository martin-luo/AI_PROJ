This document is for COMP30024 for explaining the algorithms uesd to
achieve project part A.

There are two main algorithms invovled in this program in order to find out 
the state of the board.

The first algorithm is for finding the white/black 'circles' on the board.
This algorithm is based on DFS and an heuristic of picking the next cell of 
greatest degress in clockwise direction (i.e. to draw the widdest possible
white/black cell circles).

pseudo code: 

currentCell = startCell;
circleCellCollection.add(currentCell);

while(circleCellCollection is not empty)
{
	nextCell = the 'valid' most clockwise cell of currentCell,
					from its 8 adjacent cells
	
	//valid == same colour as startCell , and it is within board dimension

	if (nextCell is empty)
	{
		circleCellCollection.remove(circleCellCollection.size()-1)
		//removing the current cell 
	}

	if(nextCell is not visited and it is not in circleCellCollection)
	{
		circleCellCollection.add(next);
	}
}

Plain description:
We will take in a cell first ,it is either black and white and then explores
its 8 adjacent cell (top-right,top,top-left,left,right,bottom-left,
bottom,bottom-right). Choose the valid and most clockwise adjacent cell
in order to draw the biggest possible cirlce from this starting cell.

If there is a valid adjacent cell then we add it to circle path , and 
update current path to this 'new valid cell'.

If there is not a valid adjacent cell we will pop the current cell out of
our circle cell collection . and update current cell to the last cell
in the 'circle cell collection'

Time Complexity: 

-for finding one circle 
	- Best Case O(n*8) ---> O(n) , where n is number of cells formed a circle ,
	8 is the constant for checking each cell's 8 adjacent cells 

	-Average Case O(n*8*d) --->O(n), d is the number of cells pop out from 
	circle collection , normally it wont be same as board dimension ,
	so it can also be considered as a constant which can be ommited
